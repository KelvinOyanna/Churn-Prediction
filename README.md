The goal of this project was to solve the problem of a telecom operator losing customers to its competitor. A predictive model was built with classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of churn (leaving a service) of a mobile telephone user. 
Random Forest classifier, XGBoost & Decision Tree algorithms were used for training & testing the model while feature engineering was extensively carried out to fine-tune and improve the accuracy of the model. More work was done in cleaning the data â€“ handling missing values and inconsistency in the data. This project was submitted in a Kaggle Competition.

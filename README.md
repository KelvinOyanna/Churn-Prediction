The goal of this project was to solve the problem of a telecom operator losing customers to its competitor.
A predictive model was built with classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of churn (leaving a service) of a telecom subscriber.

Random Forest classifier, XGBoost & Decision Tree algorithms were used for training & testing the model while feature engineering was extensively carried out to fine-tune and improve the accuracy of the model. More work was done in cleaning the data – handling missing values and inconsistency in the data
